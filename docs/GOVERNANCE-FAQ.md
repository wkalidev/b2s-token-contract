# ❓ Governance FAQ

Common questions about B2S Governance DAO.

## General Questions

### What is governance?

Governance allows $B2S token holders to vote on important protocol decisions. It's a democratic system where your voting power equals your staked tokens.

### Why should I participate?

- 📊 Shape the future of the protocol
- 🗳️ Have a say in important decisions
- 🏆 Potential rewards for active participation
- 💪 Strengthen decentralization

### How much voting power do I have?
```
Your Voting Power = Your Staked $B2S Tokens
```

Example: If you stake 5,000 $B2S, you have 5,000 votes.

## Proposals

### Who can create proposals?

Anyone with **10,000+ staked $B2S tokens** can create proposals.

### How long is the voting period?

**7 days** (~1,008 blocks on Stacks blockchain)

### What happens if my proposal fails?

Nothing negative! Failed proposals simply don't get implemented. You can refine and resubmit.

### Can I edit my proposal after submitting?

No, proposals are immutable once submitted. Double-check before creating!

### What categories exist?

## Voting

### How do I vote?

2. Browse active proposals
3. Click "Vote Yes" or "Vote No"
4. Confirm transaction

### Can I change my vote?

No, votes are final and immutable.

### Can I vote multiple times?

No, one vote per proposal per address.

### Do I need to pay gas fees?

Yes, small transaction fee (~0.001 STX) to record your vote on-chain.

### What if I don't have staked tokens?

You need to stake $B2S tokens first to gain voting power.

## Results

### What is quorum?

**20% of total staked tokens** must participate in voting for the proposal to be valid.

### What is the approval threshold?

**51% or more YES votes** are required for a proposal to pass.

### Example calculation

Scenario:
- Total staked: 1,000,000 $B2S
- Votes cast: 250,000 (25%)
- YES votes: 150,000 (60%)
- NO votes: 100,000 (40%)

Result: **PASSED** ✅
- Quorum met: 25% > 20% ✅
- Approval met: 60% > 51% ✅

### When are results final?

After the 7-day voting period ends and votes are counted.
